# Image_Caption_Generator


An Image Caption Generator is a tool that uses AI to look at a picture and automatically describe it in words, like how a person would. It combines computer vision to understand the image and language models to create captions. This technology is used in apps to help visually impaired people, suggest captions on social media, or label images in large libraries automatically.
